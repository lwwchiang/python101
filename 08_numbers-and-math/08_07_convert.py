# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
number = 6
number = float(number)
print(number)
# 2) Convert a float to an int
num2 = 6.55
num2 = int(num2)
print(num2)
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
div = 6.56/3
print(div)
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
multi = num2 * number
# What information is lost during which conversions?
